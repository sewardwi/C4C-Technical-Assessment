# C4C-Technical-Assessment
This is for the C4C Application Technical Assessment Spring 2024.

**Here are the instructions for running the message board program:**

1. First, go to https://nodejs.org/en and download the version of Node.js that is the best for your computer. This will help in running the server. 

2. Second, create a new directory in your file system for the project. Make sure that the directory is in a place that is easily accessible because we will come back to it for two things: 1. to add the files from this repository to run the server, 2. to start the server from the Terminal (Linux/Mac) or Windows PowerShell (Windows).

3. Third, access the directory through the command line.
  4. This will be through the Terminal application on Linux/Mac or through the Windows PowerShell on Windows. If you are on Windows, make sure to click "Run as Administrator" to open the Windows PowerShell application so it can makes changes to your file system.
