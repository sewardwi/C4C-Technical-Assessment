# C4C-Technical-Assessment
This is for the C4C Application Technical Assessment Spring 2024.

**Here are the instructions for running the message board program:**

1. First, go to https://nodejs.org/en and download the version of Node.js that is the best for your computer. This will help in running the server. 

2. Second, create a new directory in your file system for the project. Make sure that the directory is in a place that is easily accessible because we will come back to it for two things: 1. to add the files from this repository to run the server, 2. to start the server from the command line (Linux/Mac) or Windows PowerShell (Windows).
